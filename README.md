Tensorflow implementation of attention mechanism for text classification tasks (http://www.aclweb.org/anthology/N16-1174).

### Requirements

- Python 2.7
- Tensorflow >= 1.0
- Keras (IMDB dataset)

Sentiment classification of Russian texts using Bi-RNN with attention mechanism: https://github.com/ilivans/attention-sentiment

There I also used to visualize attention weights (the brighter color the bigger weight of the corresponding hidden state):
